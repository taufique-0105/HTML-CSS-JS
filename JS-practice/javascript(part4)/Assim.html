    <h2>Qs.1 Write an arrow function named arrayAverage that accepts an array of numbers and returns the average of
        those numbers</h2>

    <h2>Qs.2 Write an arrow function named is Even() that takes a single number as argument and returns if it is even or
        not.</h2>

    <h2>Qs.3 What is the output of the following code: <br>
        const object ={ <br>
        message: 'hello, world!', <br>
        logMessage(){ <br>
        console.log(this.message); <br>
        } <br>
        }; <br>
        setTimeout(object.logMessage, 1000); <br>
    </h2>
    <h4>ANS: After a delay of 1 second, undefined is looged to the console.
        While the setTimeout() function uses the object.logMessage as a callback, still, it invokes object.logMessage as
        a regular function, rather than a method.
        and during a regular function invocation this equals the global object, which is a window in the case of the
        browser environment. that's why console.log(this.message) inside logMessage method logs window.message, which is
        undefined.
    </h4>
    <h2>QS.4 what is the output of the following code: <br>
        let length =4; <br>
        function callback(){ <br>
        console.log(this.length); <br>
        } <br>
        const object ={ <br>
        length: 5, <br>
        method(callback){ <br>
        callback(); <br>
        }, <br>
        }; <br>
        object.method(Callback, 1,2);
    </h2>
    <h4>ANS: 'hello, world!' is looged to the console.
        object.getMessage() is a method invocation, that's why this inside the method equals object. there's also a variable declaration const message ='hello, Earth!' inside the method. the variable doesn't influence the value of this message.</h4>
