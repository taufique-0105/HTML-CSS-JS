                    <p>
                        I met a traveller from an antique lang, <br>who said-"two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
                        stand in the desert... near them, on the sand,<br> half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose
                        frown, <br> and wrinkled lip, and aneer of cold comand, <br> tell that its sculptor well those
                        passions read <br> whivh yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br> the hand that
                        mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br>and on the podestal,these words apperar my name is
                        ozymandias, king of kings; <br>
                        look on my works, ye mighty, and despair! <br> mothing beside remains. round the decay <br> of
                        that colosal wrecy, boundless and bare <br> the lone and levelsands stretch far awaj. " <br>
                    </p>
